  <h3>Personal information:</h3>
  <p>
    I was born and grew up in Melbourne. Some of my great-grandparents came from Russia, and some from Britain. 
    I have completed primary school at Eastwood Primary School, and have been studying at home for my secondary school education. 
    I have completed two online courses prior to this one – The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) part one and two. 
    Certificate of completion is available <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WGXBA5SHSU38">here</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WBW5EGEQU9VN">here<a>. I currently communicate 
    using Auslan, and written English. Since I am deaf, I cannot hear or speak English. 
    Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing with my go-kart, and programming games in Lua on my Ti-Nspire CX CAS calculator. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Interests in IT:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Low level programming (assembly, c, c++ etc)</li>
    <li>Designing computer chips (CPU, RAM, etc)</li>
    <li>programming/designing, and playing games</li>
    <li>hacking computers, finding security flaws (mainly in game consoles)</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    I am very interested in low-level computing and programming, mainly programming in C and Assembly. 
    I have had some experience programming in both languages and I want to further my knowledge.
  </p>
    
  <h3>When did your interest in IT start/Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in IT officially began when I was about eight years old, and my neighbour left her old computer 
    on her nature strip, so I brought it home and connected it and got it to work successfully!
  </p>
    
  <h3>My experiences in IT are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>programming in Python to make compilers for the Nand2Tetris course (see above)</li>
    <li>programming in C and Assembly for the Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Fixing and upgrading computers for my family.</li>
    <li>Installing/uninstalling and maintaining operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android)</li>
    <li>Setting up computers on local networks</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>
    I chose to come to RMIT because they have the most interesting and practical courses, 
    and also because they have good support for Auslan interpreters.
  </p>
    
  <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
  <p>
    I expect to gain more knowledge on how computers and programming works, 
    and how to work with IT in teams using professional tools such as Github.
