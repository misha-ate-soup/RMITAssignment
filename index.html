  <h3>Personal information:</h3>
  <p>
    I was born and grew up in Melbourne. Some of my great-grandparents came from Russia, and some from Britain. 
    I have completed primary school at Eastwood Primary School, and have been studying at home for my secondary school education. 
    I have completed two online courses prior to this one – The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) part one and two. 
    Certificate of completion is available <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WGXBA5SHSU38">here</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WBW5EGEQU9VN">here<a>. I currently communicate 
    using Auslan, and written English. Since I am deaf, I cannot hear or speak English. 
    Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing with my go-kart, and programming games in Lua on my Ti-Nspire CX CAS calculator. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Interests in IT:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Low level programming (assembly, c, c++ etc)</li>
    <li>Designing computer chips (CPU, RAM, etc)</li>
    <li>programming/designing, and playing games</li>
    <li>hacking computers, finding security flaws (mainly in game consoles)</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    I am very interested in low-level computing and programming, mainly programming in C and Assembly. 
    I have had some experience programming in both languages and I want to further my knowledge.
  </p>
    
  <h3>When did your interest in IT start/Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in IT officially began when I was about eight years old, and my neighbour left her old computer 
    on her nature strip, so I brought it home and connected it and got it to work successfully!
  </p>
    
  <h3>My experiences in IT are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>programming in Python to make compilers for the Nand2Tetris course (see above)</li>
    <li>programming in C and Assembly for the Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Fixing and upgrading computers for my family.</li>
    <li>Installing/uninstalling and maintaining operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android)</li>
    <li>Setting up computers on local networks</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>
    I chose to come to RMIT because they have the most interesting and practical courses, 
    and also because they have good support for Auslan interpreters.
  </p>
    
  <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
  <p>
    I expect to gain more knowledge on how computers and programming works, 
    and how to work with IT in teams using professional tools such as Github.
  </p>

    <h2>Ideal job</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    My ideal job is working with something low-level, such as an embedded software engineer. Link to the job on Seek is available 
    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39853941?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=8ea9200c-6c8b-44b6-ae3b-0c195151ea21">here</a>.

  <img src="images/job3.png" style="text-align:center; width:30%; height:auto;">
  <p>
    The job position is to develop embedded software for processors in electrical switchboards. I find this position appealing because 
    I have always been a fan of programming in low-level languages and learning how processors work.
  </p>
  <p>
    This job requires a degree in computer science, electrical engineering or something similar. The list of skills required is big:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Highest level of experience with C and C++ programming</li>
    <li>Experience of writing software for 32-bit embedded systems</li>
    <li>Experience with version control systems such as Git or SVN</li>
    <li>Knowledge of software development tools such as Eclipse or the GNU toolchain.</li>
    <li>Good team working</li>
  </ul>
  
  The list of skills I currently have is:
  <ul>
    <li>Mediocre C/C++ skills</li>
    <li>Equally mediocre team working skills</li>
    <li>Less than average experience with software development tools</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    My plan to acquire all the skills required to gain this job is to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, then 
    further my studies by undertaking a Masters degree, specialising in embedded programming and C/C++ programming.
