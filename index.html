  <h3>Personal information:</h3>
  <p>
    I was born and grew up in Melbourne. Some of my great-grandparents came from Russia, and some from Britain. 
    I have completed primary school at Eastwood Primary School, and have been studying at home for my secondary school education. 
    I have completed two online courses prior to this one – The Elements of Computing Systems (Nand2Tetris) part one and two. 
    Certificate of completion is available <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WGXBA5SHSU38">here</a> 
    and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/WBW5EGEQU9VN">here<a>. I currently communicate 
    using Auslan, and written English. Since I am deaf, I cannot hear or speak English. 
    Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, playing with my go-kart, and programming games in Lua on my Ti-Nspire CX CAS calculator. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Interests in IT:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Low level programming (assembly, c, c++ etc)</li>
    <li>Designing computer chips (CPU, RAM, etc)</li>
    <li>programming/designing, and playing games</li>
    <li>hacking computers, finding security flaws (mainly in game consoles)</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    I am very interested in low-level computing and programming, mainly programming in C and Assembly. 
    I have had some experience programming in both languages and I want to further my knowledge.
  </p>
    
  <h3>When did your interest in IT start/Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in IT officially began when I was about eight years old, and my neighbour left her old computer 
    on her nature strip, so I brought it home and connected it and got it to work successfully!
  </p>
    
  <h3>My experiences in IT are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>programming in Python to make compilers for the Nand2Tetris course (see above)</li>
    <li>programming in C and Assembly for the Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Fixing and upgrading computers for my family.</li>
    <li>Installing/uninstalling and maintaining operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android)</li>
    <li>Setting up computers on local networks</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>
    I chose to come to RMIT because they have the most interesting and practical courses, 
    and also because they have good support for Auslan interpreters.
  </p>
    
  <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
  <p>
    I expect to gain more knowledge on how computers and programming works, 
    and how to work with IT in teams using professional tools such as Github.
  </p>

    <h2>Ideal job</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    My ideal job is working with something low-level, such as an embedded software engineer. Link to the job on Seek is available 
    <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39853941?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=8ea9200c-6c8b-44b6-ae3b-0c195151ea21">here</a>.

  <img src="images/job3.png" style="text-align:center; width:30%; height:auto;">
  <p>
    The job position is to develop embedded software for processors in electrical switchboards. I find this position appealing because 
    I have always been a fan of programming in low-level languages and learning how processors work.
  </p>
  <p>
    This job requires a degree in computer science, electrical engineering or something similar. The list of skills required is big:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Highest level of experience with C and C++ programming</li>
    <li>Experience of writing software for 32-bit embedded systems</li>
    <li>Experience with version control systems such as Git or SVN</li>
    <li>Knowledge of software development tools such as Eclipse or the GNU toolchain.</li>
    <li>Good team working</li>
  </ul>
  
  The list of skills I currently have is:
  <ul>
    <li>Mediocre C/C++ skills</li>
    <li>Equally mediocre team working skills</li>
    <li>Less than average experience with software development tools</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    My plan to acquire all the skills required to gain this job is to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, then 
    further my studies by undertaking a Masters degree, specialising in embedded programming and C/C++ programming.

    <h2>Personal profile</h2>
  </div>
    
  <p>
    I undertook the free online Meyers-Briggs test at <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">here</a>.
    The result: I am a Virtuoso ISTP-T.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I also undertook the learning styles test at 
    <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">here</a>. The result: I am a 
    visual/tactile learner. My scores were: Auditory-20% Visual-40% Tactile-40%.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    For a further online test, I chose the career test – designed to tell you which career would be perfect for you, available 
    <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/">here</a>. I found out that I am a Technician, Conventional, Uninhibited, 
    Values Oriented and Maximizing.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I think those tests showed me that I am a detail-oriented person, which is something I didn’t realise. I also found out 
    that I am not good with money, which should be obvious but I had no idea about that until now. The results of those tests 
    will probably influence my behaviour in a team by showing that I am probably not a good team leader and that I always 
    take my time to make sure that everything is perfect. Taking this into account when forming a team, I need to make sure 
    that: 1) I am not the team leader. 2) I should start work early on my tasks so I can complete them to my highest standards.

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  </div>
    
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    My project idea is to build a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)  emulator in Minecraft, without using the command block. 
    I plan to construct an entire NES out of redstone – using pistons, redstone torches, redstone repeaters, switches, etc. It 
    will have a working 6502 CPU, 2KB RAM and 6 bit video output. It will have the ability to play NES ROMs, and have emulated 
    controller support via Minecraft buttons. I will use redstone to build elementary logic gates such as AND, NOT and OR then 
    build the console on the top of those gates. Flip-flops can be built to store 1-bit values and then stored in a row of 8 
    for a single 8-bit register.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The thing keeping me motivated to do this project is the fact that I am building a game console inside of a game! I have 
    always loved video game consoles and building one from scratch is enormous fun and very educational and will give me a lot 
    of skills which are valuable for future employment. Another reason why I want to do this project is because I really want 
    to own a NES, but their rarity and high price force me to look elsewhere to play video games. The solution is to use an 
    emulator, which I have made myself!
  </p>
    
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    The NES will be made entirely out of redstone, without the aid of the command block. It will consist of a 6502 CPU. 
    Normally, the CPU runs at around 1.79 or 1.66MHz, depending on the region. Unfortunately, due to Minecraft running on 
    Java, which is an interpreted language (and the speed of my actual computer’s CPU being mediocre), achieving that speed 
    in game is very difficult. Thus the virtual console will run much slowly than the actual console. The CPU’s clock, in 
    Minecraft, will be powered by a three redstone torches (which are really NOT gates in disguise) in a loop, effectively 
    creating a clock. This clock will power the data flip-flops which “remembers” a bit every cycle, unless being written 
    to. As for the game ROM cartridges in real life, I will build up an array of about, say, 512K of 8-bit registers and 
    “lock” them by removing the ability to write to them, thus effectively making them read-only. I will then search for 
    a desired game online and download its binary code, and then manually hard-code each bit into each data flip-flop. I 
    took a course on how to build a CPU, RAM and a ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) so the process of building the processor 
    should be relatively straightforward. <br>
As for the controller, I visualise the player looking at the screen, the controller below them – in form of simple buttons
    which corresponds to real controller. There are only eight simple digital buttons, so that means we don’t have to mess
    around with fiddly analogue signals. <br>
The great thing about the 6502 CPU is that it was one of the most popular CPUs back in the 1980s and it is still popular 
    today. Thus there is a mountain of documentation about it which will be a necessity for learning how to build one. It is 
    a common challenge for programmers to try and emulate it on modern computers through a language like C++. <br>
I may add the ability to automatically flash the ROM with a game image through the aid of a Minecraft modification, although
    that may be breaking some rules. In my opinion, the trickiest part to build will be the screen, as the NES had a 6-bit video
    palette, so there are 64 different colours available for each pixel, which in Minecraft will be very tricky to build with 
    just redstone, pistons and a limited range of blocks. Another tricky chip to port to redstone is the PPU 
    (Picture Processing Unit), which is an early version of the modern GPU (graphics processing unit). It itself has a 2KB
    RAM for drawing graphics, and has specialised circuitry designed to draw graphics quicker than the CPU. <br> 
If I was to actually do this project, I would happily upload the world online and let anyone try out my emulator. 
    It’s pretty amazing if you think about it: there are so many layers of different computer architectures on the 
    top of each other. At the bottom is my actual computer – an x86-64 architecture. Next layer is the Java virtual machine
    running on the top of x86. Next is the Minecraft game, which finally interprets the NES emulator down all the way to x86
    – four layers of completely different instruction codes set!
  </p>
    
  <h3>Tool and technologies</h3>
  <p>
    For the technology part, all I am using is my humble x86-64 architecture computer. As for the software part, I need 
    the Java runtime environment, which Minecraft runs on. Minecraft itself is needed of course. Java is free to use, but 
    Minecraft is $35AUD. For extensive redstone projects, which if done all by hand (500,000 data flip-flops!) will take a
    very long time. A great online tool that lets you copy-paste redstone contraptions which saves a lot of time is 
    available <a href="http://mordritch.com/mc_rss/">here</a>. I also use a simple Web browser like Chrome to research about the 6502.
  </p>
    
  <h3>Skills required</h3>
  Skills essential for the construction of an emulator in Minecraft are the following:
  <ul>
    <li>A good understanding of how redstone works in Minecraft</li>
    <li>Good understanding of how simple logic gates connects together to make a complex chip</li>
    <li>Skill in programming assembly code for CPUs and tracking down bugs (very difficult in assembly!)</li>
    <li>Have expert Googling skills – required for trying to find a specific information about the architecture or the system as a whole</li>
    <li>Experience with Minecraft. You need a good understanding of the Minecraft API if you want to program mods for the game</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>
    If the project was successful, anyone who has purchased Minecraft, will also have the ability to play classic Nintendo
    Entertainment System games by only going to the internet and downloading a map! Anyone thinking, “Oh, I wish I had a NES
    emulator in Minecraft,” would get their wish! This project will be a useful resource to the general public, because if 
    they are interested to learn how the 6502 CPU works, they can download my map and have a look! I will make sure to leave
    plenty of signs describing how a particular component works.
